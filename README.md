# Control of Chaos

Chaotic systems has properties like sensitive dependence to initial conditions, trasitivity and dense set of periodic orbits. The chaotic sytems are deterministic yet hard to predict due to rapid growth in error introduced due to noise or numerical errors etc. It is intuitive to think that controlling chaos is impossible or atleast very hard to control.
