# Control of Chaos

Chaotic systems have properties like sensitive dependence on initial conditions, transitivity and a dense set of periodic orbits. The chaotic systems are deterministic yet hard to predict due to rapid growth in error introduced due to noise or numerical errors, etc. It is intuitive to think that controlling chaos is impossible or at least very hard to control.

The OGY method proposed by Ott, Gregori and Yorke in 1990 has demonstrated its ability to control chaos in several systems, taking advantage of the properties of chaos (these properties are thought to be undesirable). 

The code of this OGY method applied to several chaotic systems is uploaded to this repository.
